- switch pallet blit sse2 to use maskmoveu so we can simplify it's alignment code

- add padding to internal image buffer allocations so that vector instructions can run past the end of the image (eg: pallet blit using maskmoveu to do stores might read up to 14 bytes past the end of the image)

- switch to using the julia_vis_pixel_format based pallet init function in at least all software versions so we can freely change the resulting channel orders in the pallet to make the 16 bit blitters better.

- make an SDL2 version, use nuklear as UI and let user switch between visualizer modes.
   - Also select audio input
     - refactor audio subsystem to support this
   - Also let user switch between software and OpenGL visualizer
       - Should grab existing state images to start up different modes to make things smooth?
   - Add support for SDL2 Audio backend for recording

- Use newer audio API on Windows natively. (WASPI)
   - default to using loopback on default output device.

- Build a release binary of SDL2 version
